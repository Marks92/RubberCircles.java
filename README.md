# RubberCircles.java

This Java project allows a user to create "rubberbanding" circles. The user can click and drag white circles on
a blue background. A radius line will pop up indicating the radius in pixel lenght of each circle. The rubberbanding
effect allows for a new circle to be created with each click and drag of the mouse across the screen. This project only
allows for one circle to be created at a time. The first click of the mouse will be the center of the circle and the circle
will be as large as the radius being dragged by the mouse.
